        "DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT: Online social media users are not all equally susceptible to misinformation; their level of susceptibility depends on their biases. The interplay between an observer's biases and the diverse forms of misinformation they encounter is what we call in this paper `diverse misinformation'. Our paper explores deepfakes as a type of misinformation as a means to investigate how U.S. social media users' biases generally impact susceptibility to misinformation online. We choose deepfakes as a case study of the impacts of diverse misinformation for two reasons: 1.) their status of being misinformation is binary; they either are a deepfake or are not; 2.) deepfakes are a current real-world concern with associated harms that need to be better understood. \n",
